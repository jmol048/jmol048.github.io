Jessica Mollick is a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Psychiatry where she conducts research in the lab of Dr. Hedy Kober. Her research focuses on learning, decision making and addiction, and she is currently conducting research on substance use disorders and decision-making and fMRI meta-analysis work on the neural representation of prediction errors. She focuses on using value-based decision-making models to understand the effects of addiction on decision-making behavior and reward learning and computational neural network
models of the basal ganglia, amygdala and dopamine system.

## Current Interests and Projects:
I focus on applying computational models to characterize the neural mechanisms involved in learning positive and negative associations for cues and actions, focusing on the brain systems involved in computing prediction error signals, and applying these to both appetitive (reward) and aversive (punishment) contexts.

In my postdoctoral research, I study the effect of substance use disorders on learning and decision-making behaviors. In an ongoing study, I am examining the effect of drug craving on decision-making for wins and losses using a gambling task, and the effects of craving on valuation and learning in a prediction error task. We also examine social decision-making, examining how risk computations differ when participants make gambling decisions both for themselves and on behalf of another person.
